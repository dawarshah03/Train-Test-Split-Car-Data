# Car-Price-Prediction-with-Train-Test-Split

I used Linear Regression to predict car sell prices based on mileage and age.

I used matplotlib to make scatter plots of Mileage vs Price and Age vs Price to see how they relate.

I selected Mileage and Age as input (x) and Sell Price as output (y).

Then I used train_test_split to divide the data â€” 80% for training, 20% for testing.

After that, I created a Linear Regression model using SkLearn.

I trained the model using the training data.

Then I used the model to predict prices on the test data.

Finally, I used the score function to check how accurate the model is on the test set.

This project is mainly to show how train_test_split works and how to train and test a regression model using it.

Code and dataset are in the repo.
